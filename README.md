# create-release-action

<img alt= "" src="https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/create-release-action/raw/main/assets/github-actions-octopus.png" />

This is a GitHub Action to create a release in [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/).

**\*NOTE:** if you have used earlier versions of this action, as of v3 of this action there is no longer a dependency to the Octopus CLI, so the installer action is no longer required in order to use this step.\*

## Releases in Octopus Deploy

A release is a snapshot of the deployment process and the associated assets (packages, scripts, variables) as they existed when the release was created. The release is given a version number, and you can deploy that release as many times as you need to, even if parts of the deployment process have changed since the release was created (those changes will be included in future releases but not in this version).

When you deploy the release, you are executing the deployment process with all the associated details, as they existed when the release was created.
